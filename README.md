The study Habibi. et al exposed volunteers to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the pathogen responsible for the common cold to asses the role of the mucosal microenvironment
in early responses to respiratory viral infections. The study is showing that neutrophilic inflammation in the airway at the time of pathogen exposure predisposes
individuals to symptomatic infection while a mild and transient increase in nasal inflammatory mediators is accompanied by termination of viral infection. Also, the airway 
microbiome is not associated with susceptibility to infection.

After two weeks 57% of inoculated volunteers became infected.
The main factor distinguishing the infected from the noninfected was that:
- the infected group showed signs of airway neutrophil activation before exposure to RSV
- the non-infected individuals showed enhanced interleukin-17 signaling soon after virus inoculation. 

Transcriptome analysis of the nasal tissue samples before inoculation showed neutrophilic inflammatory signal in the subjects who develop symptomatic infection.
This signal was associated with suppression of an early IL-17 dominated immune response during the presymptomatic period and Â followed by symptomatic
infection associated with the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.
